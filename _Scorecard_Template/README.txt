This is the template for a new scorecard.

If running SAS 9.3+, you only need to copy the `SAS_Inputs` folder into a new project folder named `Scorecard_[YEAR]_SAS`, collect data, and then run the code. (SAS will create the additional folders that it needs.)

If running SAS 9.2-, you MUST copy ALL the template folders. (Old versions of SAS can't create folders.)
